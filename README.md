# Flutter Multi-Language Template with State Management

Welcome to the Flutter Multi-Language Template with State Management! This project is designed to provide you with a solid foundation for building Flutter applications that support multiple languages (Arabic, Hebrew, and English) while incorporating a state management approach to streamline your development process.

## Getting Started

To kickstart your project using this template, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-multilanguage-template.git
   ```

2. **Localization Setup:**

   - Open the `lib/utils/localization.dart` file to configure and manage the localization settings for your application. You can add or modify language translations here.

   ```dart
   class AppLocalizations {
     static const List<Locale> supportedLocales = [
       Locale('en', 'US'), // English
       Locale('ar', 'SA'), // Arabic
       Locale('he', 'IL'), // Hebrew
     ];
   
     static const LocalizationsDelegate<AppLocalizations> delegate =
         AppLocalizationsDelegate();
   
     // Add your translations here
     // ...
   }
   ```

3. **State Management:**

   - This template utilizes a state management approach. You can choose your preferred state management solution (e.g., Provider, Bloc, Riverpod) and integrate it into the project structure under the `lib` directory.

4. **Start Developing:** You're now ready to start building your Flutter application. Use this template as a foundation, and feel free to add widgets, screens, and logic to suit your project's requirements.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project structure:

- **lib:** Contains the main Dart code for your Flutter application.
  - **main.dart:** Entry point of your app, where you can configure the initial route and theme.
  - **utils:** Contains utility functions and classes.
  - **screens:** Organize your app's screens or pages here.
  - **widgets:** Create reusable widgets to use across your app.
  - **providers:** If using Provider for state management, place your providers here.
  - **blocs:** If using Bloc for state management, organize your blocs here.
- **assets:** Store your assets like images and fonts in this directory.
- **locales:** Store your language translation files here for each supported language (e.g., `en.json`, `ar.json`, `he.json`).

## Localization

This template includes support for three languages: Arabic, Hebrew, and English. To add or modify translations for your application, edit the corresponding language JSON files in the `locales` directory. Make sure to update the `AppLocalizations` class in `lib/utils/localization.dart` accordingly.

## State Management

Choose your preferred state management solution and integrate it into the project structure. Whether you opt for Provider, Bloc, Riverpod, or another package, the template provides the flexibility to accommodate your chosen approach.


Happy coding!
